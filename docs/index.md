# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

## What is QMK Firmware?

QMK (*Quantum Mechanical Keyboard*) is an open source community that maintains QMK Firmware, QMK Flasher, qmk.fm, and these docs. QMK Firmware is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard](http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](http://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](http://www.ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](http://clueboard.co/). It has also been ported to ARM chips using ChibiOS. You can use it to power your own hand-wired or custom keyboard PCB.
